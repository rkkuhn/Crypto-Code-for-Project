This is a basic example, and in a real-world application, you would need to handle key exchange securely (perhaps using a protocol like Diffie-Hellman), and you should also use authenticated encryption (like AES/GCM) to protect against various types of attacks.

To run the program, compile the three Java files, start the Peer in one terminal with a specific port number, and then start the Client in another terminal with the hostname (or IP address) and the same port number as arguments.

Please note that the secret keys in the Peer and Client classes are generated independently, so in a real-world scenario, you would need to ensure both parties share the same secret key for successful encryption and decryption. This is typically done through a secure key exchange protocol.
